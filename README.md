# Introduction to Nutriguin

Diets play significant roles in everyday life and well-being; our diet directly impacts our health and happiness. Many people struggle to stick to healthy eating habits as it can be hard to find the time and resources to plan and prepare meals. They lack accessible and convenient tools to inform and inspire their decisions. Our project sets out to aid health-conscious people in preparing healthy meals at home and finding food-focused balanced diet options from local stores. The app will promote a well-balanced and still delicious diet by encouraging users to make better choices.

Our application Nutriguin will provide recommendations of healthy dishes available at stores and detailed healthy food recipes that include the meals' nutrients, calories and other dietary information. Through this, our app will equip individuals with the tools to take their dietary health into their own hands through informed choices and accessibility. Each user will have a profile that they can use to save their favourite meals, creating a convenient list of what the user knows they like. This same profile can be used to rate other meals on the app and is required for various possible future additions to the application.
